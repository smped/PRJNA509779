  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As high-throughput sequencing platforms produce
              longer and longer reads, sequences generated from short inserts,
              such as those obtained from fossil and degraded material, are
              increasingly expected to contain adapter sequences. Efficient
              adapter trimming algorithms are also needed to process the
              growing amount of data generated per sequencing run. FINDINGS: We
              introduce AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval
              v1, which introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput,
              through the use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD; SSE1
              and SSE2) instructions and multi-threading support, (ii) the
              ability to handle datasets containing reads or read-pairs with
              different adapters or adapter pairs, (iii) simultaneous
              demultiplexing and adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to
              reconstruct adapter sequences from paired-end reads for poorly
              documented data sets, and (v) native gzip and bzip2 support.
              CONCLUSIONS: We show that AdapterRemoval v2 compares favorably
              with existing tools, while offering superior throughput to most
              alternatives examined here, both for single and multi-threaded
              operations.",

              demanded from read aligners. The full-text minute index is often

              Bowtie 2 combines the strengths of the full-text minute index
              with the flexibility and speed of hardware-accelerated dynamic

              studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst
              numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common
              approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large
              sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project
              can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier
              samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.
              RESULTS: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report
              visualising output from multiple tools across many samples,
              enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified.
              MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and

              become exceedingly cheap, facilitating studies to be undertaken
              containing large sample numbers. Quality control (QC) is an
              essential stage during analytic pipelines and the outputs of
              popular bioinformatics tools such as FastQC and Picard can
              provide information on individual samples. Although these tools
              provide considerable power when carrying out QC, large sample
              numbers can make inspection of all samples and identification of
              systemic bias a challenge. RESULTS: We present ngsReports, an R
              package designed for the management and visualization of NGS
              reports from within an R environment. The available methods allow
              direct import into R of FastQC reports along with outputs from
              other tools. Visualization can be carried out across many samples
              using default, highly customizable plots with options to perform
              hierarchical clustering to quickly identify outlier libraries.

              DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become a valuable and widely used
              approach for mapping the genomic location of transcription-factor
              binding and histone modifications in living cells. Despite its
              widespread use, there are considerable differences in how these
              experiments are conducted, how the results are scored and
              evaluated for quality, and how the data and metadata are archived
              for public use. These practices affect the quality and utility of
              any global ChIP experiment. Through our experience in performing
              ChIP-seq experiments, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have
              developed a set of working standards and guidelines for ChIP
              experiments that are updated routinely. The current guidelines
              address antibody validation, experimental replication, sequencing
              depth, data and metadata reporting, and data quality assessment.
