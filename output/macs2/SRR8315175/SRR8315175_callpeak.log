# ARGUMENTS LIST:
# name = SRR8315175
# format = BAM
# ChIP-seq file = ['data/deduplicated/SRR8315175.sorted.bam']
# control file = ['data/deduplicated/SRR8315192.sorted.bam']
# effective genome size = 2.70e+09
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# qvalue cutoff = 5.00e-02
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 1000 bps and 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is off
# MACS will save fragment pileup signal per million reads
